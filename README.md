Unemployment in India – Data Analysis Project
📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes unemployment trends in India using data-driven techniques. The goal is to understand how unemployment rates vary across different states and regions and how they change over time. The analysis highlights regional disparities and helps identify areas requiring targeted policy intervention.

📊 Dataset Description

The dataset contains unemployment-related indicators for various Indian states and regions, including:

Unemployment Rate (%)

Region / State

Time period (monthly or yearly, depending on data)

Additional employment-related metrics (if available)

The data enables comparison between regions with high, moderate, and low unemployment levels.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

Python

Jupyter Notebook

Pandas – data manipulation

Matplotlib & Seaborn – data visualization

NumPy – numerical analysis

🔍 Analysis Performed

Data cleaning and preprocessing

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Regional comparison of unemployment rates

Trend analysis over time

Visualization of unemployment patterns

📈 Key Insights

Unemployment in India shows significant regional variation

Certain states consistently experience higher unemployment rates

Trends fluctuate over time due to seasonal and economic factors

A few regions contribute disproportionately to overall unemployment

✅ Conclusion

The analysis demonstrates that unemployment in India is unevenly distributed and influenced by regional economic conditions. Addressing unemployment effectively requires region-specific strategies, skill development programs, and sustained economic planning rather than uniform national policies.
